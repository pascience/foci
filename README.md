Even though this repo is a fork of [Wingo](https://github.com/BurntSushi/wingo), my aim is not to build a window manager. If you're looking for a program that might be of any use to you, you will be disappointed!

For some time, the README is pretty much the only thing I'm going to edit. I have some long-term goals, but it is not clear yet what their priorities are. Feel free to discuss whatever is written here via the issue tracker.
